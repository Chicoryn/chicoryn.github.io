Hi, I am Karl. I am a hacker, according to the original definition not the Hollywood one, if you do not know the difference then this is probably not the place for you.

This is not a blog, nor an attempt to build any sort of community, this is a place where I put some of my thoughts that has no better place to go but I want to archive for the future. If you want to read them you are welcome to, but I take no responsibility for the long-term consequences.
